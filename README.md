Twitter's Bootstrap
===================

This package contains the [Bootstrap HTML/CSS/JS library](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/getting-started.html), along a composer.json file and a Mouf installer file to add Bootstrap easily in your Mouf2 projects.

This package contains the bare Bootstrap framework. If you are looking for a Mouf2 *template* that contains Bootstrap, have a look at [html.template.bootstrap](http://mouf-php.com/packages/mouf/html.template.bootstrap/).
